# Talent Sourcing and Management Pipeline

This project aims to automate the talent sourcing and management process for a talent sourcing company. The goal is to develop a machine learning-powered pipeline that can identify and rank potential candidates based on their fitness for specific roles. The pipeline includes keyword-based candidate search, candidate ranking, manual review, and candidate re-ranking based on supervisory signals.

## Background

As a talent sourcing and management company, the process of finding talented individuals for technology companies is challenging due to the need to understand the client's requirements and the qualities that make a candidate shine in a particular role. Additionally, identifying where to find talented individuals poses another challenge. The current process involves manual operations, and the company wants to automate and optimize this process to save time and identify the best-fit candidates efficiently.

## Data Description

The data used in this project comes from the company's sourcing efforts. Personal details have been removed, and each candidate is assigned a unique identifier. The attributes of the candidate data include:

- **id**: Unique identifier for the candidate (numeric)
- **job_title**: Job title for the candidate (text)
- **location**: Geographical location of the candidate (text)
- **connections**: Number of connections the candidate has (text)
- **fit**: Target variable indicating how fit the candidate is for the role (numeric, probability between 0 and 1)

## Pipeline Overview

The talent sourcing and management pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Preprocessing**: The candidate data is preprocessed to remove personal details, tokenize job titles, and perform text normalization (lowercasing, removing stopwords, lemmatization, etc.).
2. **Keyword-Based Candidate Search**: Candidates are searched based on specific keywords provided, such as "Aspiring human resources" or "seeking human resources," to match the role being filled.
3. **Candidate Ranking**: A ranking algorithm is used to calculate the fitness scores for each candidate based on their job titles' similarity to the provided keywords and the number of connections they have.
4. **Manual Review**: The candidates are manually reviewed, and a supervisory signal is provided by starring a candidate who is considered an ideal fit for the role.
5. **Candidate Re-Ranking**: Whenever a candidate is starred, the candidate list is re-ranked based on the supervisory signal, ensuring the most suitable candidates are prioritized.

## Implementation Details

The pipeline implementation involves the following components:

- **DataProcessor**: This class handles data preprocessing, keyword-based candidate search, candidate ranking, and candidate re-ranking. It utilizes libraries such as NLTK, Gensim, scikit-learn, and sentence-transformers for text processing, word embedding, and similarity calculation.
- **Fit Prediction Model**: A machine learning model can be trained to predict the fitness of candidates based on available information. Various models such as logistic regression, random forest, or gradient boosting can be explored and evaluated to identify the most accurate fit prediction model.
- **Bias Prevention**: To mitigate human bias in the candidate selection process, it is essential to standardize and automate the procedure. This can be achieved by defining clear criteria for candidate selection, ensuring diverse training data, and periodically auditing the model's performance to identify and correct any biases.

## Success Metrics and Evaluation

The success of the talent sourcing and management pipeline can be evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Candidate Ranking**: The pipeline should effectively rank candidates

 based on their fitness scores. A higher fitness score indicates a better match for the role.
- **Re-Ranking Improvement**: Each time a candidate is starred during the manual review, the re-ranked list should show improvement, with higher-ranked candidates becoming more suitable for the role.
- **Cut-Off Point**: By analyzing the fitness scores and manual review outcomes, a suitable cut-off point can be determined. This cut-off point can be applied to other roles to filter out candidates who are unlikely to be a good fit, without excluding high-potential candidates.

## Bonus Ideas

To further automate the talent sourcing and management procedure and prevent human bias, the following ideas can be explored:

- **Automated Pre-Screening**: Implement an automated pre-screening process that evaluates candidates based on additional criteria, such as skills, experience, or education. This can be achieved through the use of natural language processing techniques and machine learning models.
- **Diversity Enhancement**: Introduce measures to ensure diversity and inclusivity in the candidate selection process. This can include analyzing and addressing any bias present in the training data, diversifying the sources of candidate data, and considering additional attributes that promote diversity during candidate ranking.
- **Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback loop system that allows reviewers to provide feedback on candidate selections, allowing continuous improvement of the pipeline and refinement of the ranking algorithm.
